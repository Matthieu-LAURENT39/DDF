There are two types of parsing: lax and strict.
Some rules are only enforced during strict parsing. These rules are prefixed with a !

Each date group should start with a "header" line with this format: ["dd/mm/yyyy"]
Only header lines can start with [ and end with ]
Any data before the first header is called the "file header". It will left as-is.
!The file header should be separated by 2 blank lines from the first header

!There should be no blank line between the date header and the first data line
!Each data line should be separated by a single newline
!There should be a single blank line between the last data line and the next header
!Dates without entry should not be present in the file
!The file should end with a single newline


An exemple file:
"""
[17/04/2023]
my first very cool data line
my cool second data line
I sure do love data (3rd line)

[18/04/2023]
Wow, this is another cool day

[20/04/2023]
No entries yesterday
"""
